How many calls and SMSes subscribers are making.

SELECT caller_num, call_type, COUNT(*)FROM cdr GROUP BY caller_num, call_type;

Problem Statement-2
We want to find out the total duration of time for which a subscriber is making voice calls:

SELECT caller_num, SUM(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(end_time , "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSX") - UNIX_TIMESTAMP(start_time, "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSX"))  as duration
FROM cdr group by caller_num, call_type HAVING  call_type = 'VOICE';

Problem Statement-3
Find out the customers who spend the most amount of money and offer them better packages.

SELECT caller_num, sum(call_charge) AS bill FROM cdr GROUP BY caller_num ORDER BY bill DESC LIMIT 5;

Problem Statement-4
Round off the bill as follows:
SELECT caller_num, round(sum(call_charge)) AS bill FROM cdr GROUP BY caller_numORDER BY bill DESC LIMIT 5;

Problem Statement-5
Find out how many times a call was placed but the called number was busy:
